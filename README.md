### What I learned

This project level is 'NEWBIE' and I learned I am a newbie. 

Starting off with the basic HTML and CSS files, I began working on the desktop view.  After 30 minutes, I scrapped the files and started over.  This is when I learned the importance of having a CSS reset to begin projects.  This is a helpful tool to get started and something I missed (or was not discussed) in the tutorials I've completed.

The CSS reset I used was created by Josh W Comeau, and you can view it here https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/.

I will admit, I spent 25 to 30 minutes trying to figure out why the cart icon and text within the button were not aligned.  I tried everything I learned from those CSS and HTML tutorials, but then found a little thing called justify-content.  Entered the code and boom, frustration turned into accomplishment.  I'm still a newbie so I'm not sure if this was the correct approach, but it worked visually and I was ready to complete the challenge.

### Continued development

I will be continuing with the challenges at Frontend Mentor.  These will help me improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to be proficient at web development.
